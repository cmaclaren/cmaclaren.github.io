## 🎓 About Me

I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from **[Villanova University]** in 2023, and recently completed a Fulbright research scholarship at the **[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **[artifical intelligence and machine learning]** and **[translatable clinical tools]**.

Currently, I am working on problems related to:

- 🧠 [Behavioral analysis from clinical video footage]
- 📊 [Low memory usage, energy efficient cancer diagnostic tool]

I am passionate about researching how we can leverage **artifical intelligence arhcitectures** for **practically useful in medicine**, and I enjoy collaborative research and open-source development.
